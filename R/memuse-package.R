#' Core memuse Classes and Methods
#' 
#' Originally an amusing fancy printing system, this package contains that, as
#' well as some functionality for showing.  As of version 2.0, the package
#' contains some helpful utilities for accessing hardware ram information, ram
#' usage of the current R process, as well as some other niceties.
#' 
#' If you do a lot of benchmarking, this is the package you've been waiting
#' for.  Maybe.  I mean, I don't want to be too pushy about it.
